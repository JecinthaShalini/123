<p>The <b>tomato</b> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is a <u>fruit</u> from the nightshade family native to South America.
Despite botanically being a fruit, it’s generally eaten and prepared like a vegetable.
Tomatoes are the major dietary source of the antioxidant <u>lycopene</u>, which has been linked to many health benefits, including <u>reduced risk of heart disease and cancer.</u>
They are also a great source of <b>vitamin C, potassium, folate, and vitamin K.</b>
Usually red when mature, tomatoes can also come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, green, and purple. What’s more, many subspecies of tomatoes exist with different shapes and flavor.</p>
